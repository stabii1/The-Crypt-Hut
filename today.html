 <h1>The Capelobo</h1>
 <h2>May 2, 2024</h2>
 <p>It was just about 4 a.m. when an otherworldly scream cut through the forests lining the Xingu River in northern Brazil.
  A couple walking along a nearby road hurried to hide behind a rubber tree.
  From that vantage point, they could see a shadowy figure approaching them.
  As it grew closer, they recognized the outline of a man, but the creature was covered in animal hair and emitted a vile smell.
  It screamed again, its blood-curdling call echoing under the forest canopy, before disappearing into the trees.
  The only evidence it left behind was a row of perfectly round footprints in the dirt.
  The husband and wife would feel sick for days after the encounter as if poisoned by the noxious odor, but they had been spared a worse fate.</p>
 <p><i>“It’s Capelobo! It’s Capelobo!”</i> a Yudjá woman who witnessed this near meeting told her grandson some years later;
  he related the tale to a researcher in 2019. This capelobo had once been a man,
  but it was now a monster, prowling through the night feeding on human blood and brains <i>(and also on puppies and kittens)</i>.
  Along the Xingu in the Brazilian state of Pará, a capelobo is said to resemble a humanoid tapir with a hooked snout.
  Along the Pindaré River in the state of Maranhão to the northeast, it looks more akin to an anteater,
  killing by sucking out its victim’s gray matter as if it were devouring termites in a mound.</p>
